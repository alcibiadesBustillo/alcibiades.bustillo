abstract = {We construct a new family of 3D periodic arrays suitable for water-marking video. Each member of the family is composed of columns of cyclic shifts of a Sidelnikov sequence in which the shifts are given by an m x n "grid" that is determined by applying a logarithmic quadratic map to the elements of a direct product Zm| x Zn. These arrays have peak auto-correlation on the order of p4 and non-peak auto- and cross-correlation on the order of p2 and unlike other constructions have unequal dimensions.},

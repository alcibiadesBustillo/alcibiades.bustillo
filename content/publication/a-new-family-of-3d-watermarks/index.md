abstract: We construct a new family of 3D periodic arrays suitable for
  water-marking video. Each member of the family is composed of columns of
  cyclic shifts of a Sidelnikov sequence in which the shifts are given by an $m
  \times n$ "grid" that is determined by applying a logarithmic quadratic map to
  the elements of a direct product $Z_m \times Z_n$. These arrays have peak
  auto-correlation on the order of p4 and non-peak auto- and cross-correlation
  on the order of $p^2$ and unlike other constructions have unequal dimensions.
